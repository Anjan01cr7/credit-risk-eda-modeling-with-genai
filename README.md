# Credit Risk EDA & Modeling with GenAI

This project explores and models customer credit delinquency risk using a real-world inspired dataset provided through the Tata GenAI-powered Data Analytics simulation.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit data
- Identify key factors contributing to delinquency
- Build and evaluate predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network)
- Compare models using precision, recall, F1 score
- Investigate fairness and bias in predictions

---

## 📁 Project Structure
📁 data/ → Raw dataset (Delinquency_prediction_dataset.csv)
📁 notebooks/ → Jupyter Notebooks for EDA & ML models
📁 reports/ → Final Word/PDF reports (EDA summary, model writeups)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- Keras (Neural Network)
- Word for report documentation
- GitHub for version control & publishing

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- Credit utilization, missed payments, and debt-to-income ratio were major predictors of delinquency
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree performed well with precision and recall over 75%
- Neural Network gave slightly higher F1 but was more complex to interpret
- Fairness analysis showed no strong bias by location, but unemployed users had slightly higher false positives

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Collect more recent and balanced data
- Explore SHAP/LIME for interpretability
